    "- The code you write should ask the user for a name and age. That is, the code should work, without any change, no matter what name and age the user types. This is called writing code that is general (in the sense of general-purpose); the same code works with any reasonable data. The opposite would be code that includes Alice Anteater's actual name and the age 19 in the Python code itself, so that the code would always print out the same thing (Alice Anteater's information) every time. That's called hard-coded data, and it's much less flexible and useful. We'll see situations where hard-coding certain constants is the right approach, but this isn't one of them.\n",
    "- One key approach to writing a program is to base it on a similar program that you already have. (Even professional programmers do this; professional development environments contain pre-written frameworks for different kinds of tasks and the internet is full of open-source code repositories that professionals can use to avoid reinventing the wheel.) In this case, you can start with the salary code you copied and pasted earlier. It contains nearly all the elements you need to do the name-and-age task; you just need to reassemble them and change the words to produce the new behavior."
